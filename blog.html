    <h1> Discuss the scope of var, let, and const? </h1>
    <p class="ans"> <span class="ans1">Ans:</span> One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you.

        In this article, we'll discuss var, let and const  with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the differences between them that I'll point out
        Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

        The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
        
        var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
        
        To understand further, look at the example below.let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.
        Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations
        This behavior is somehow different when it comes to objects declared with const. While a const object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated. Therefore, if we declare a const object as this:

    <h1> Tell us the use cases of null and undefined? </h1>
    <p class="ans" ><span class="ans1" > Ans: </span> 
    
        We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming.

        Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.
        
        When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to a variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.
        There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly.

As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.

Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.

   <h1> What do you mean by REST API? </h1>
   <p class="ans" > <span class="ans1" > Ans: </span>




    An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.

    First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices architecture.

    Uniform interface. All API requests for the same resource should look the same, no matter where the request comes from. The REST API should ensure that the same piece of data, such as the name or email address of a user, belongs to only one uniform resource identifier (URI). Resources shouldn’t be too large but should contain every piece of information that the client might need.

    Client-server decoupling. In REST API design, client and server applications must be completely independent of each other. The only information the client application should know is the URI of the requested resource; it can't interact with the server application in any other ways. Similarly, a server application shouldn't modify the client application other than passing it to the requested data via HTTP.

    Statelessness. REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request needs to include all the information necessary for processing it. In other words, REST APIs do not require any server-side sessions. Server applications aren’t allowed to store any data related to a client request.

    Cacheability. When possible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server side. Server responses also need to contain information about whether caching is allowed for the delivered resource. The goal is to improve performance on the client side, while increasing scalability on the server side.

    Layered system architecture. In REST APIs, the calls and responses go through different layers. As a rule of thumb, don’t assume that the client and server applications connect directly to each other. There may be a number of different intermediaries in the communication loop. REST APIs need to be designed so that neither the client nor the server can tell whether it communicates with the end application or an intermediary.

    Code on demand (optional). REST APIs usually send static resources, but in certain cases, responses can also contain executable code (such as Java applets). In these cases, the code should only run on-demand.
    creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.

    The state of a resource at any particular instant, or timestamp, is known as the resource representation. This information can be delivered to a client in virtually any format including JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular because it’s readable by both humans and machines—and it is programming language-agnostic.
    
    Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls because they include important identifier information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers (URIs), caching, cookies and more. Request headers and response headers, along with conventional HTTP status codes, are used within well-designed REST APIs.
